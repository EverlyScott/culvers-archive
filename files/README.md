# How this directory works

Every file in this directory, and it's sub directories, have a `.json` file with the same as it which contains information of how it's supposed to be displayed to the user. Directories have to have this file aswell.

For example, if I have a file named `picture.jpg`, the info file would be `picture.jpg.json`.

**More documentation coming soon.**
